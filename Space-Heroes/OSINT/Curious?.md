I've been thinking about going on vacation recently and need to know where off Earth I can find these dunes. What sol was this image taken on?

I initally tried using Google Images reverse search, however, I wasn't getting anywhere with this. I decided to throw it into [Tineye](https://tineye.com/) to see if I could get a better result. 

I came across an article written in Russian with the image in it.

I don't speak Russian, however, the reference to a date in 2014 followed by a mention of 533 and sol after led me to believe this would be correct. A quick Google Translate confirmed this.
