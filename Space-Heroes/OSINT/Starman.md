The space car mentioned in the description is the Tesla Roadster which was used as a dummy payload in the February 2018 Falcon Heavy test flight. After having a look at some of the sites that offer tracking of this car I noticed one had a calendar that allowed for a user to select a time.

Using this calendar we can see how far Spacman was from Earth.
