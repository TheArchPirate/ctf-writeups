# The Root of All Evil... OR... Adding Insult to Injury | Exploitation

## Description

Great news! Luciafer has been spotted at an internet cafe! She's using her laptop right now! We can catch her, if we act quickly.

We need your help. Can you figure out a way to remotely connect to her machine and capture the flag?

Her username on her system is luciafer, and her hostname is:
batescafe.deadface.io

Use the PCAP from Monstrum ex Machina

## Location of PCAP

You can find a copy of this pcap in my writeups repository. If you would like a copy, please go to:

## Solution

The challenge tells us that the answer is in the PCAP file, by this point I had completed the traffic analysis challeneges and had already stumbled across this. I knew what I was looking for was an SSH key. I searched the string "begin" and got the private SSH key.

I moved this to ~/.ssh and attempted to connect to the machine using:

`ssh -i luciafer luciafer@batescafe.deadface.io`

This was a success and I got access to the machine. I then ran the command:

`find flag / | grep flag`

This told me where the flag was located. I navigated to /home/luciafer/Downloads/flag.txt. I used cat to read the flag.

## Flag
